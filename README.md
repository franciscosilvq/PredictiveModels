# Predictive_models
Predictive models of Machine Learning with R and h2o.ai 

This project aimed to use the programming language R to process data, in this case several records from a database of a credit institution, and later identify patterns, graphs and other objects that allow a complete exploratory analysis of the data.
Subsequently, using the Machine Learning platform h2o.ai, run predictive algorithms that would help to more successfully estimate the quality/behavior of the future customers of this company and thus obtain a better decision assessment of this institution.
